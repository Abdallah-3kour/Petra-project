      <h3>WADI RUM</h3>

      <P>
        Known also as the <span class="rum-style">Valley of the Moon</span> is a valley cut into the sandstone and granite rock in 
        southern Jordan 60 km (37 mi) to the east of Aqaba; it is the largest wadi in Jordan.
      </P>

      <p>
          <span class="rum-style">Name :</span>  Rûm is the Arabic term for the Romans, particularly those of the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire. 
          However, Wadi Rum is believed to get it name from the early name of Iram of the Pillars,a lost city mentioned in the Quran.

      <h4>History</h4>
      <div class="rump1">
        <p>
          Wadi Rum has been inhabited by many human cultures since prehistoric times, with many cultures–including the Nabataeans–leaving their mark in the form of petroglyphs, 
          inscriptions, and temple. In the West, Wadi Rum may be best known for its connection with British officer T. E. Lawrence, who passed through several times during the Arab Revolt of 1917–18. 
          In the 1980s one of the rock formations in Wadi Rum, originally known as Jabal al-Mazmar (The Mountain of (the) Plague), was named "The Seven Pillars of Wisdom," after Lawrence's book penned in the 
          aftermath of the war, though the 'Seven Pillars' referred to in the book have no connection with Rum.

        Lawrence described his entrance into the Valley of Rumm, "The hills on the right grew taller and sharper, a fair counterpart of the other side which 
        straightened itself to one massive rampart of redness. They drew together until only two miles divided them: and then, towering gradually till their parallel 
        parapets must have been a thousand feet above us, ran forward in an avenue for miles. The crags were capped in nests of domes, less hotly red than then body of the hill; 
        rather grey and shallow. They gave the finishing semblance of Byzantine architecture to this irresistible place: this processional way greater than imagination."

        Lawrence also described his encounter with the spring, Ain Shalaaleh, "On the rock-bulge above were clear-cut Nabathaean inscriptions, and a sunk panel incised with a monogram or symbol. 
        Around and about were Arab scratches, including tribe-marks, some of which were witnesses of forgotten migrations: but my attention was only for the splashing of water in a crevice under the 
        shadow of the overhanging rock. I looked in to see the spout, a little thinner than my wrist, jetting out firmly from a fissure in the roof, and falling with that clean sound into a shallow, frothing pool, 
        behind the step which served as an entrance. Thick ferns and grasses of the finest green made it a paradise just five feet square."
      </p>

      <p>
        The discovery of the Nabataean Temple (located walking distance from the Rest House) in 1933 briefly returned the spotlight to the desert. 
        A French team of archaeologists completed the excavations in 1997.
