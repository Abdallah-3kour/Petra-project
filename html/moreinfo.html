    <h3>Description</h3>

    <h5>- Water control</h5>
    
    <p>
        Excavations have demonstrated that it was the ability of the Nabataeans to control the water supply that led to the rise of the desert city, 
        creating an artificial oasis. The area is visited by flash floods, but archaeological evidence shows that the Nabataeans controlled these floods 
        by the use of dams, cisterns and water conduits. These innovations stored water for prolonged periods of drought and enabled the city to prosper from its sale.
    </p>

    <h5>- Access routes</h5>

    <p>
        In ancient times, Petra might have been approached from the south on a track leading across the plain of Petra, 
        around Jabal Haroun ("Aaron's Mountain"), the location of the Tomb of Aaron, said to be the burial place of Aaron, brother of Moses. 
        Another approach was possibly from the high plateau to the north. Today, most modern visitors approach the site from the east. The impressive eastern 
        entrance leads steeply down through a dark, narrow gorge, in places only 3–4 m (10–13 ft) wide, called the Siq ("shaft"), a natural geological feature formed from a 
        deep split in the sandstone rocks and serving as a waterway flowing into Wadi Musa.
    </p>

    <h5>- City centre</h5>

    <p>
        At the end of the narrow gorge, the Siq, stands Petra's most elaborate ruin, popularly known as Al-Khazneh ("the Treasury"), hewn into the sandstone cliff. 
        While remaining in remarkably preserved condition, the face of the structure is marked by hundreds of bullet holes made by the local Bedouin tribes that hoped to 
        dislodge riches that were once rumoured to be hidden within it.A little farther from the Treasury, at the foot of the mountain called en-Nejr, is a massive theatre, 
        positioned so as to bring the greatest number of tombs within view. At the point where the valley opens out into the plain, the site of the city is revealed with striking effect. 
        The theatre was cut into the hillside and into several of the tombs during its construction. Rectangular gaps in the seating are still visible. Almost enclosing it on three sides are rose-coloured mountain walls, 
        divided into groups by deep fissures and lined with knobs cut from the rock in the form of towers.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Petra Pool and Garden Complex is a series of structures within the city center. Originally said to be a market area,
        excavations at the site have allowed scholars to identify it as an elaborate Nabataean garden, which included a large swimming pool, 
        an island-pavilion, and an intricate hydraulic system.
    </p>

    <h5>- Exterior platform</h5>

    <p>
        In 2016, archaeologists using satellite imagery and drones discovered a very large, previously unknown monumental structure whose beginnings were tentatively dated to about 150 BC, 
        the time when the Nabataeans initiated their public building programme. It is located outside the main area of the city, at the foot of Jabal an-Nmayr and about 0.5 mi (0.80 km) south of the city centre, 
        but is facing east, not towards the city, and has no visible relationship to it. The structure consists of a huge, 184 by 161 ft (56 by 49 m) platform, with a monumental staircase along its eastern side. 
        The large platform enclosed a slightly smaller one, topped with a comparatively small building, 28 by 28 ft (8.5 by 8.5 m), which was facing east toward the staircase. The structure, second in size only to the Monastery 
        complex, probably had a ceremonial function of which not even a speculative explanation has yet been offered by the researchers.
