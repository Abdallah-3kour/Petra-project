        <h3>PETRA</h3>
        
        <p>
            The ancient city of Petra is one of Jordan’s national treasures and by far its best known tourist attraction. <br>
            Petra is the legacy of the Nabataeans, an industrious Arab people who settled in southern Jordan more than 2,000 years ago. <br>
            Admired then for its refined culture, massive architecture and ingenious complex of dams and water channels, <br>
            Petra is a UNESCO World Heritages Site and one of the new Seven Wonders of the World. Inhabited by the Nabateans, Edomites and Romans, <br>
            Petra brought together the knowledge and skill of these civilizations to create this world wonder. Caravans laden with incense, silks, <br>
            spices and other exotic goods would rest at Petra.</p>

        <h3>WADI RUM</h3>
        
        <p>“The Valley of the Moon”, 
            depicted as Mars in several Hollywood feature films

            Home to nomadic Bedouin tribes, Wadi Rum is a a quiet getaway of stars, sand, and sun; <br>

            Wadi Rum allows you to get lost in large landscapes and horizon lines. <br>
            The calmness of the desert is sure calm your spirit and de-clutter your spirit and de-clutter your thoughts. <br>
